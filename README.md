This repository was created for the game The Big Fives, which aims to meet the requirements of the [Boss Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/boss-rush-jam-2025) game jam.


## Theme
To be published.

## Game Design
```javascript
  async object.index({
   gameEngine: 'Unity',
   coding: 'C#', 'JSON',
   assets: [
    purchased: true,
    free: true,
    ownCreation: true
   ],
   softwares: [
    imagesEdit: 'GIMP', 'Inkscape', 'PixageFXStudio',
    codeScripting: 'VS Code', 'Visual Studio',
    spriteSheet: 'SpriterPro', 'FatiadorAlinhador',
    modeling: 'Blender', 'Meshy',
   ]
  });
  
  return response.status(201).send();
```

Most of art was extracted from 3D asset following [this](https://forums.rpgmakerweb.com/index.php?threads/camera-angle-to-create-2d-images-from-3d-models.111104/) instructions. Basically:
- it is necessary to set the camera to 45 degrees
- remove the perspective
- activate the orthogonal/isometric view
- move model and print (according to demand)
- edit image in your favorite software (I use GIMP)
